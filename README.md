# Trenching tool to estimate strengths of trenching layouts

## Aims
Create a model to assess and aid archaeological evaluations in the UK. 
Building on [previous work](https://cris.brighton.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/50172170/RichardHigham_thesis_University_of_Brighton_corrected_17052024.pdf) (Higham, 2024) this model moves away from a python simulation of trenching layouts and creates a tool in which a user can input the coordinates of the boundaries of a site, the type of archaeology searched for, the dimensions of the trench, and the percentage coverage of trenching in the budget. This model then produces an optimal layout based on the coverage available and measure of how likely the layout is to find the archaeology imputed.
